                             based on my experiences ai is very helpful tools specially in academic. Ai is help to improve our learning and knowledge in many ways Ai can give more information and ideas that help student to learn more. Ai can generate examples. but in the other hand ai have a some disadvantage impact in students. being lazy and rely always in Ai.

                            Black box AI refers to the issue of an artificial intelligence system’s internal mechanics being unclear or hidden from users and even developers. You may be able to view how an AI model takes in inputs and produces outputs, but the logic and data used to reach those results are not accessible, making it difficult — or even impossible — to fully see how they operate.
                            In other words, “you can see what goes into it, you can see what comes out, but you can’t pop it open to see the inner workings,” explained Stephanie Pulford, head of data at AI company ON. The opposite of black box AI is explainable AI, which is a set of principles and processes that seek to help users understand how AI models arrive at their outputs. Black box AI is a term used to describe artificial intelligence systems whose internal workings and decision-making processes are not transparent, making it unclear how they arrived at their conclusions. AI models that can be characterized as “black box AI” are embedded in our everyday lives. They power facial recognition software used to unlock our phones, AI voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini and hiring algorithms used to screen job candidates.
